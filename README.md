# Story Computing Machine

A shared-universe fiction workspace. A writing prompt becomes a complete story
through specialist outline, prose, independent review, and cover assignments:

```text
prompt.md → outline.md → story.md → review.md → title-image.jpg
```

The stories and universe notes are the product. Production stays in these five
artifacts, with Git preserving history and Pages publishing a stored snapshot.

## Start a story

Open the primary checkout in Codex and submit a prompt:

```text
[WP] Every city has a ghost assigned to it. Tonight, ours resigns.

Target: about 3,000 words; close third person; melancholy but hopeful.
```

Put additional context in a separate paragraph. Attach any visual references to
the request. The coordinator prepares a dedicated branch and sibling worktree,
then follows [story-create](.agents/skills/story-create/SKILL.md#workflow) through
a draft pull request. New stories are non-canon; promotion is a separate user
decision. For named replacements and localized edits, see
[permissions](AGENTS.md#canon-lock-and-story-editing).

## Project map

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): authority, permissions, artifact boundaries, worktrees.
- [universe/](universe/README.md): shared facts;
  [style guide](universe/style-guide.md): narrative policy and craft profiles.
- [story-create](.agents/skills/story-create/SKILL.md): coordination and completion.
- [story-room](.agents/skills/story-room/SKILL.md): outline, review, cover contracts,
  scaffold, and validation scripts.
- [short-story-writing](.agents/skills/short-story-writing/SKILL.md): prose adapter;
  other craft skills are pinned references tracked by `skills-lock.json`.
- `.codex/agents/`: four specialist entry points.
- [stories/](stories/README.md): current and supported bundle packages;
  `_template/` supplies the four-file scaffold.
- `pages/catalog.json`, `pages/covers/`: publication snapshot.
- `pages/timeline.json`: curated chronology; `universe/` remains authoritative.

The Chronology places individual stories along a proposed sequence of Galactic
Cycles. Civilizations and familiar social forms recur across the sequence;
stories are not collected into thematic era panels. Every publication has one
cycle, a distinct schematic position, and a placement rationale in
`pages/timeline.json`. Established local intervals and the worldline backbone
constrain the proposal; exact Galactic dates remain unresolved. Connections lead
between individual positions, with direct links distinguished from echoes.
The validator requires complete coverage, increasing positions within each
cycle, and valid connection endpoints before Pages can build.

## Local commands

Install the Python dependencies, Markdown and Pillow:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r pages/requirements.txt
```

Run these from the story worktree at the appropriate workflow stage:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -File .agents/skills/story-room/scripts/Test-Stories.ps1 -Story <slug> -Phase PreReview
pwsh -NoProfile -File .agents/skills/story-room/scripts/Test-Stories.ps1 -Phase Final
python pages/build.py capture <slug>
python pages/build.py check
```

PreReview checks the current scaffold and declarations. Final checks the
completed structure, verdicts, inventory, and decodable cover. Semantic and
visual judgment remains with the reviewers. Bundle prose receives only
compatible checks.

For tooling changes and a local site preview:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s pages -p "test_*.py" -v
python pages/build.py build --output _site
```

Capture derives the public prompt on first publication and preserves editorial
catalog text on recapture. `capture-all` refreshes existing catalog entries only.
Both refuse canon demotion; see [Pages rules](AGENTS.md#pages). GitHub Actions
builds and deploys the stored snapshot after merge; it does not reopen story
sources or run production review.
